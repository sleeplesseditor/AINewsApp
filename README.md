# AI News App

An experiment in building an accessible news application with the AI Voice Assistant Alan and React, based on [Adrian Hajdin's JavaScript Mastery tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqw3OftE5sA&t=351s).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app working with commands from a user, fetching news articles and then reading through the resultant headlines.

To get the app up and running, you will need API keys from [Alan AI](https://alan.app/) and the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), along with relevant interactions created on your own Alan account.

1) npm install
2) Implement the env file with your Alan AI API key as 'REACT_APP_ALAN_APP_KEY'
3) npm start
